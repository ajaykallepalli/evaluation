of eight as we concluded that merging target diseases and vaccines would make the

available and used in recent years have been added. Also the section on integration

IIP should be a training document and therefore written in a teaching style, or remain

in practice\n(2)39\nBasic maintenance of cold chain \nequipment\n6.1\t Defrosting vaccine refrigerators\nA refrigerator only works well if it is properly installed and is then cleaned and \ndefrosted regularly. \nThick ice in the freezer compartment and on the evaporator plate does not keep \na refrigerator cool. Instead, it makes the refrigerator work harder and uses more \nelectricity, gas, kerosene or solar power. Refrigerators should be defrosted regularly, or \nwhen the ice is more than 0.5 cm thick, whichever comes first.\nTo defrost and clean a refrigerator:\n• Remove all the vaccines and transfer them to another refrigerator or to a cold box \nor vaccine carrier lined with conditioned ice packs.\n• Switch off the electrical supply for a mains or solar-battery refrigerator. Turn off the \ngas supply for a gas refrigerator. Extinguish the flame for a kerosene refrigerator.\n• Leave the door open and wait for the ice to melt. Never try to remove the ice with \na knife or ice pick; this can permanently damage the refrigerator. A pan of boiling \nwater can be placed inside and the door closed. \n• Clean the inside of the refrigerator and door seal with a clean damp cloth.\n• Re-start the refrigerator. Do not adjust the thermostat. \n• When the temperature in the main section falls to +8 °C or lower (but not less than \n+2 °C), arrange the vaccines, diluents and water packs in their appropriate places.\n6\nIf a refrigerator needs to be defrosted more than once a month, check for these \ncommon problems:\n¾\n¾ Staff are opening the door too often (more than three times daily). \n¾\n¾ The door is not closing properly.\n¾\n¾ The door seal needs to be replaced.Module 2:  The vaccine cold chain\n(2)40\nImmunization in practice\n6.2 \t Maintaining solar power systems\nSolar panels need to be cleaned and checked and the batteries of solar battery \nrefrigerators must be inspected and maintained. Tasks can be divided into daily, \nperiodic and annual.\nDaily"",""metadata"":{}},{""text"":""(see Section 7 of this module). \nRemember: slight heat exposure is less damaging to most liquid vaccines and diluents \nthan freezing exposure. \nIf the temperature is above +8 °C, which is too high, a report should be made to the \nsupervisor. The corrective action includes the following procedure:\n• Make sure that the refrigerator is working. If it is not working, check whether the \npower supply (electricity, gas, kerosene or solar) is adequate.\n• Check whether the door of the refrigerator or the freezing compartment closes \nproperly; if the seal is broken, the temperature will fluctuate.

Basic maintenance of cold chain 
equipment
6.1	 Defrosting vaccine refrigerators
A refrigerator only works well if it is properly installed and is then cleaned and 
defrosted regularly. 
Thick ice in the freezer compartment and on the evaporator plate does not keep 
a refrigerator cool. Instead, it makes the refrigerator work harder and uses more 
electricity, gas, kerosene or solar power. Refrigerators should be defrosted regularly, or 
when the ice is more than 0.5 cm thick, whichever comes first.
To defrost and clean a refrigerator:
• Remove all the vaccines and transfer them to another refrigerator or to a cold box 
or vaccine carrier lined with conditioned ice packs.
• Switch off the electrical supply for a mains or solar-battery refrigerator. Turn off the 
gas supply for a gas refrigerator. Extinguish the flame for a kerosene refrigerator.
• Leave the door open and wait for the ice to melt. Never try to remove the ice with 
a knife or ice pick; this can permanently damage the refrigerator. A pan of boiling 
water can be placed inside and the door closed. 
• Clean the inside of the refrigerator and door seal with a clean damp cloth.
• Re-start the refrigerator. Do not adjust the thermostat. 
• When the temperature in the main section falls to +8 °C or lower (but not less than 
+2 °C), arrange the vaccines, diluents and water packs in their appropriate places.

If a refrigerator needs to be defrosted more than once a month, check for these 
common problems:
¾
¾ Staff are opening the door too often (more than three times daily). 
¾
¾ The door is not closing properly.
¾
¾ The door seal needs to be replaced.Module 2:  The vaccine cold chain

6.2 	 Maintaining solar power systems
Solar panels need to be cleaned and checked and the batteries of solar battery 
refrigerators must be inspected and maintained. Tasks can be divided into daily, 
periodic and annual.
Daily

(see Section 7 of this module). 
Remember: slight heat exposure is less damaging to most liquid vaccines and diluents 
than freezing exposure. 
If the temperature is above +8 °C, which is too high, a report should be made to the 
supervisor. The corrective action includes the following procedure:
• Make sure that the refrigerator is working. If it is not working, check whether the 
power supply (electricity, gas, kerosene or solar) is adequate.
• Check whether the door of the refrigerator or the freezing compartment closes 
properly; if the seal is broken, the temperature will fluctuate. Call a technician to 
make repairs.
• Check whether frost is preventing cold air in the freezing compartment from 
entering the refrigerator compartment. Defrost if necessary.
• If the power supply, door seal and frost levels are all in working order, turn the 
thermostat knob so that the arrow points to a higher number. This will make the 
refrigerator cooler. 
• If the temperature cannot be maintained between +2 °C and +8 °C, store vaccines 
in other cold chain equipment that can maintain this temperature range until the 
refrigerator is repaired.
Remember: to avoid freezing vaccines, do not adjust the thermostat to a cooler (higher 
number) setting after a power cut or when vaccines arrive.Module 2:  The vaccine cold chain

4.3	 Maintaining the correct temperature in cold boxes 
and vaccine carriers 
To maintain the correct temperature in cold boxes and vaccine carriers, proceed as 
follows:
• Place the correct number and type of properly conditioned ice packs or cool water 
packs in the cold box or vaccine carrier. 
• If you are using conditioned ice packs you should preferably put an electronic freeze 
indicator in each cold box or vaccine carrier containing freeze-sensitive vaccines.
• Keep the cold box or vaccine carrier in the shade. 
• Keep the lid tightly closed.

Weekly
• Clean the burner, flue and baffle as shown in the instruction manual. 
• Trim the wick as shown in the instruction manual. Use a wick trimmer if possible.
• Check that there is enough kerosene for at least another week. If not, replenish the 
supply immediately. 
Periodic tasks
• Check the fuel tank to see if there is sediment at the bottom. If there is, blow out 
the burner and remove the tank. Remove the burner from the tank. Empty out the 
dirty kerosene. Flush the tank with a little clean kerosene. Wipe the outside of the 
tank with a clean cloth dipped in kerosene. Replace the burner and refill the tank. 
• Replace the wick when you cannot turn it up any more to trim it. Use the correct 
type of wick and follow the instruction manual. Always keep two spare wicks in a 
safe place. 
6.5 	 Managing vaccine refrigerator breakdowns 
If a vaccine refrigerator stops working, first protect the vaccines and then check the 
cause of the problem.
Protecting the vaccines 
Move the vaccines to other cold chain equipment until the refrigerator is repaired. 
For a problem that can be solved quickly, a cold box or vaccine carrier lined with 
conditioned ice packs can be used for temporary storage. For a problem that might 
take longer to solve, another refrigerator is needed. Always keep a freezer indicator 
with the freeze-sensitive vaccines. 
Restoring the refrigerator to working order

• Check the electric cables between the solar array, the charge regulator, the batteries 
and the refrigerator. Inspect grounding/lightning protection. If you see any damage, 
contact your supervisor.Module 2:  The vaccine cold chain

6.3 	 Maintaining gas refrigerators
Daily
• Check the burner flame is blue. If it is not, clean the gas burner and gas jet as 
described in the equipment manual. Adjust the thermostat or flame control setting 
as necessary.
• Make sure there is enough gas in the bottle. If not, change the bottle. Always 
change the bottle before it is completely empty and always keep a spare bottle.
Periodically
• Check weekly that you have enough gas for at least another week. If not, obtain a 
new supply immediately.
• Carry out the following tasks at least once a year and always clean the flue if the 
flame has been smoking.
−	 Clean the flue and baffle as described in the equipment manual.
−	 Clean the gas burner and gas jet as described in the equipment manual.
−	 Check the gas line connections for leaks. Brush soapy water onto the 
connections. If bubbles form, there is a leak. Gas leaks are dangerous. Contact 
your supervisor unless you have been trained to repair leaks yourself.
6.4 	 Maintaining kerosene refrigerators
Daily 
• Fill the tank with clean kerosene. Always fill the tank before it is completely empty. 
Always keep enough spare kerosene to ensure you never run out. Never use any 
other fuel (e.g. diesel or gasoline).

a “Prevent, Protect and Treat” framework, which is discussed in Section 19 \nof this module.\n12.8\tWhat is rotavirus vaccine?\nThe currently available rotavirus vaccines (RV) contain one or more live attenuated \n(weakened) virus strains. They are given orally to protect against rotavirus \ngastroenteritis. They do not protect against other causes of diarrhoea, a fact that is \nimportant to emphasize in health education.\nTwo oral rotavirus vaccines are available: Rotarix® (RV1 or monovalent RV), which \ncontains one strain; and RotaTeq® (RV5 or pentavalent RV), which contains five \nstrains.\nRotarix® comes in single-dose freeze-dried (also called lyophilized) powder and in \nliquid forms. Freeze-dried RV1 must be reconstituted using diluent in a prefilled oral \napplicator. Liquid Rotarix® is ready to use in an oral applicator or a squeezable tube. \nAll of these must be stored between +2 °C and +8 °C without being frozen. They \nshould be used immediately after reconstitution or opening. If not used immediately, \nreconstituted freeze-dried vaccine can be stored between +2 °C and +8 °C or at \nambient temperatures of less than 25 °C and used within 24 hours (see Table 1.18).\nRotaTeq® is a ready-to-use liquid that should be stored at a temperature of between \n+2 °C and +8 °C without freezing. It should be used as soon as possible after being \nremoved from the refrigerator.Module 1:  Target diseases and vaccines\nImmunization in practice\n(1)53\n12.9\tHow safe are rotavirus vaccines and what are the potential \nadverse reactions?\nThe available rotavirus vaccines are safe and well tolerated.

12.8	What is rotavirus vaccine?
The currently available rotavirus vaccines (RV) contain one or more live attenuated 
(weakened) virus strains. They are given orally to protect against rotavirus 
gastroenteritis. They do not protect against other causes of diarrhoea, a fact that is 
important to emphasize in health education.
Two oral rotavirus vaccines are available: Rotarix® (RV1 or monovalent RV), which 
contains one strain; and RotaTeq® (RV5 or pentavalent RV), which contains five 
strains.
Rotarix® comes in single-dose freeze-dried (also called lyophilized) powder and in 
liquid forms. Freeze-dried RV1 must be reconstituted using diluent in a prefilled oral 
applicator. Liquid Rotarix® is ready to use in an oral applicator or a squeezable tube. 
All of these must be stored between +2 °C and +8 °C without being frozen. They 
should be used immediately after reconstitution or opening. If not used immediately, 
reconstituted freeze-dried vaccine can be stored between +2 °C and +8 °C or at 
ambient temperatures of less than 25 °C and used within 24 hours (see Table 1.18).
RotaTeq® is a ready-to-use liquid that should be stored at a temperature of between 
+2 °C and +8 °C without freezing. It should be used as soon as possible after being 
removed from the refrigerator.Module 1:  Target diseases and vaccines

12.9	How safe are rotavirus vaccines and what are the potential 
adverse reactions?
The available rotavirus vaccines are safe and well tolerated. There is a low risk of 
intussusception (about one to two per 100 000 infants vaccinated; see box on 
intussusception). Both are approved for administration with other vaccines in infant 
immunization programmes. Mild adverse reactions include irritability, runny nose, ear 
infection, vomiting and diarrhoea (in 5% or more of children vaccinated).

known, but boosters are also not recommended.
Key points about rotavirus gastroenteritis
¾
¾ Rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis in infants and young children.
¾
¾ The disease spreads by the faecal-to-oral route and the virus is stable in the 
environment.
¾
¾ Severe disease can lead to rapid dehydration resulting in shock and death if fluids 
are not replaced quickly by ORS and, if needed, intravenous infusion.
¾
¾ Vaccination is the best prevention for rotavirus gastroenteritis since safe water 
and sanitation measures are less effective in preventing rotavirus infections than 
in preventing other causes of diarrhoea.
¾
¾ Rotavirus vaccination prevents only rotavirus gastroenteritis and should be 
included as part of a comprehensive treatment and prevention strategy to control 
diarrhoea.Module 1:  Target diseases and vaccines

DT, Td, TT, HepB, DTP+HepB, DTP+HepB+Hib, Hib, HPV, rotavirus and/or 
any other freeze-sensitive vaccines. Never put freeze-sensitive vaccines in the bottom 
baskets. In some models there is a risk of freezing in these areas. 
• Store the diluents close to the freeze-dried vaccine with which they were supplied. 
If this is not possible, make sure the diluents are clearly labelled so they can be

The use of Hib vaccines should be part of a comprehensive strategy to control 
pneumonia including exclusive breastfeeding for six months, handwashing with soap, 
improved water supply and sanitation, reduction of household air pollution, and 
improved case management at community and health facility levels. Hib disease is 
included in the 2013 integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea, 
which outlines a “Prevent, Protect and Treat” framework (see Section 19 of this module).
2.8 	 What are Hib-containing vaccines?
Hib-containing vaccines prevent pneumonia, meningitis, epiglottitis, septicaemia and 
other Hib disease. They do not protect against other types of Haemophilus influenzae 
or other bacteria that cause similar diseases.
Hib-containing vaccines are available in stand-alone and combination forms. Hib 
combined with DTP and HepB vaccines, or pentavalent vaccine (DTP+HepB+Hib), 
reduces the number of injections an infant has to receive while completing the 
recommended immunization schedule.
Hib-containing vaccines are supplied in liquid or freeze-dried powder (also called 
lyophilized) formulations in single- and multi-dose presentations. Pentavalent 
vaccine is available in two- and 10-dose vials. Pentavalent vaccine with a freeze-dried 
Hib component requires reconstitution: see Module 5 (Managing an immunization 
session), Section 4.2 for details. The diluent for pentavalent vaccine is the DTP+HepB 
component. Hib-containing vaccines must be stored between +2 °C and +8 °C 
without being frozen. Freezing does not damage stand-alone freeze-dried Hib vaccine 
but does damage liquid Hib and pentavalent vaccines. If freezing is suspected, 
the Shake Test should be performed to determine whether a vial is safe to use (see 
Module 2 (The vaccine cold chain), Section 7). Opened multi-dose vials must be 
handled according to national multi-dose vial policy (see Module 2, Section 5 for

There are six types of Haemophilus influenzae that have an outer capsule. \nOf these six capsular types, type b is the largest public health concern. Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b, or Hib, causes 90% of all serious Haemophilus influenzae infections.\nHib is responsible for severe pneumonia, meningitis and other invasive diseases, almost \nexclusively in children aged less than 5 years.\n2.2\t How is Hib spread?\nHib is spread from person to person in droplets released when sneezing and coughing. \nChildren may carry Hib in their noses and throats without showing any symptoms or \nsigns of illness (also known as healthy carriers), but they can still infect others.\n2.3\t What are the symptoms and signs of Hib disease?\nThe serious diseases caused most frequently by Hib are pneumonia and meningitis."",""metadata"":{}},{""text"":""months to five years of age.\n18.4\tWhat are symptoms and signs of vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A deficiency (VAD) reduces resistance to infections, leading to more severe \nand prolonged illnesses and increasing the risk of death. It can cause eye damage, such \nas corneal lesions and, when severe, can cause blindness. Generally, the first clinical \nsign of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness (impaired vision in dim light). Because \nvitamin A deficiency reduces the body’s resistance to infection, it is a threat even before \nany direct signs become apparent. \nChildren suffering from vitamin A deficiency are more likely to get infections, such as \nmeasles, as well as diarrhoea and fevers.

Haemophilus influenzae type b 
disease
2.1	 What is Haemophilus influenzae type b?
Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium found commonly in the nose and throats of 
children. There are six types of Haemophilus influenzae that have an outer capsule. 
Of these six capsular types, type b is the largest public health concern. Haemophilus 
influenzae type b, or Hib, causes 90% of all serious Haemophilus influenzae infections.
Hib is responsible for severe pneumonia, meningitis and other invasive diseases, almost 
exclusively in children aged less than 5 years.
2.2	 How is Hib spread?
Hib is spread from person to person in droplets released when sneezing and coughing. 
Children may carry Hib in their noses and throats without showing any symptoms or 
signs of illness (also known as healthy carriers), but they can still infect others.
2.3	 What are the symptoms and signs of Hib disease?
The serious diseases caused most frequently by Hib are pneumonia and meningitis.

months to five years of age.
18.4	What are symptoms and signs of vitamin A deficiency?
Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) reduces resistance to infections, leading to more severe 
and prolonged illnesses and increasing the risk of death. It can cause eye damage, such 
as corneal lesions and, when severe, can cause blindness. Generally, the first clinical 
sign of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness (impaired vision in dim light). Because 
vitamin A deficiency reduces the body’s resistance to infection, it is a threat even before 
any direct signs become apparent. 
Children suffering from vitamin A deficiency are more likely to get infections, such as 
measles, as well as diarrhoea and fevers. These infections are more likely to be severe, 
sometimes resulting in death.
18.5	What is vitamin A supplementation?
When diets do not contain food with enough vitamin A, it is possible to increase 
vitamin A levels in the body by periodically taking a concentrated dose in the form of 
a capsule. This is called supplementation. When given to children, vitamin A capsules 
are cut open and the drops of liquid inside are squeezed into the mouth.
Vitamin A supplementation can be combined with immunization services for children 
when health officials know or suspect that vitamin A deficiency is present in an area or 
among a certain population.
In addition, vitamin A supplements are also given for the treatment of measles and 
xerophthalmia (dryness of the eyes that can lead to corneal damage and blindness).
18.6	Are there any side effects of vitamin A supplements?
There are usually no side effects. On rare occasions, a child may experience headache, 
loss of appetite or vomiting. These symptoms pass in time, and no treatment is 
necessary. Parents should be advised that this is normal.Module 1:  Target diseases and vaccines

deficiency
Immunization programmes provide an opportunity to deliver other essential health 
services such as vitamin A supplementation, de-worming, malaria prevention with 
insecticide-treated nets and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness. These 
additional services are part of EPI Plus programmes. Vitamin A deficiency is discussed 
further here.
18.1	Vitamin A deficiency
Any immunization contact is an opportunity to screen infants and young children for 
eligibility to receive vitamin A, particularly if vaccinations have been delayed and the 
child is six months or older.
18.2	What is vitamin A?
Vitamin A is a substance that is required by the human body. It strengthens resistance 
to infection, increases a child’s chances of surviving an infection, promotes growth and 
protects the cornea (the transparent part of the eye). Lack of vitamin A, or vitamin A 
deficiency, can result in poor vision in dim light.
The human body cannot make vitamin A. So all the vitamin A it needs must come 
from food intake. Vitamin A is present in the following foods:
• breast milk
• liver, eggs, meat, fish liver oil
• milk, cheese and other dairy products
• yellow and orange fruits, such as mangoes and papayas
• yellow and orange vegetables, such as pumpkins and carrots
• dark green, leafy vegetables
• red palm oil.
Vitamin A can be added to such foods as sugar, vegetable oil and wheat flour during 
processing. This is called food fortification.

workers should obtain throat cultures from suspected \ncases. However, treatment should begin urgently without waiting for culture results.\n1.6 \t How is diphtheria prevented?\nThe most effective way to prevent diphtheria is to maintain a high level of \nimmunization in the community. In most countries, diphtheria vaccine is given in \ncombination with tetanus and pertussis vaccines (DTP). Some countries now use \npentavalent vaccine that combines DTP with hepatitis B (HepB) and Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. Pentavalent (DTP+HepB+Hib) vaccine reduces the \nnumber of injections needed for infant immunization. Sections 1.7–1.9 and Table 1.1 \nbelow describe diphtheria-containing vaccines.\n1.7 \t What are diphtheria-containing vaccines?\nDiphtheria-containing vaccines include: the combination with tetanus toxoid (DT/\ndT); the combination with tetanus and pertussis (DTP); and the combination with \ntetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (pentavalent). They \nare supplied in single- and multi-dose presentations. Pentavalent vaccine with a freeze-\ndried (also called lyophilized) Hib component requires reconstitution: see Module 5 \n(Managing an immunization session), Section 4.2 for details. They must be stored \nbetween +2 °C and +8 °C without being frozen. Pentavalent vaccine is freeze-sensitive. \nIf freezing is suspected, the “Shake Test” should be performed to determine whether \na vial is safe to use (see Module 2 (The vaccine cold chain), Section 7). Opened multi-\ndose vials must be handled according to national multi-dose vial policy (see Module 2, \nSection 5 for WHO policy).\nDiphtheria-containing vaccines are administered as 0.5 ml doses given intramuscularly"",""metadata"":{}},{""text"":""pneumonia.\n¾\n¾ Each pneumococcal vaccine protects against disease caused only by the \npneumococcal serotypes that it contains.

cases. However, treatment should begin urgently without waiting for culture results.
1.6 	 How is diphtheria prevented?
The most effective way to prevent diphtheria is to maintain a high level of 
immunization in the community. In most countries, diphtheria vaccine is given in 
combination with tetanus and pertussis vaccines (DTP). Some countries now use 
pentavalent vaccine that combines DTP with hepatitis B (HepB) and Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. Pentavalent (DTP+HepB+Hib) vaccine reduces the 
number of injections needed for infant immunization. Sections 1.7–1.9 and Table 1.1 
below describe diphtheria-containing vaccines.
1.7 	 What are diphtheria-containing vaccines?
Diphtheria-containing vaccines include: the combination with tetanus toxoid (DT/
dT); the combination with tetanus and pertussis (DTP); and the combination with 
tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (pentavalent). They 
are supplied in single- and multi-dose presentations. Pentavalent vaccine with a freeze-
dried (also called lyophilized) Hib component requires reconstitution: see Module 5 
(Managing an immunization session), Section 4.2 for details. They must be stored 
between +2 °C and +8 °C without being frozen. Pentavalent vaccine is freeze-sensitive. 
If freezing is suspected, the “Shake Test” should be performed to determine whether 
a vial is safe to use (see Module 2 (The vaccine cold chain), Section 7). Opened multi-
dose vials must be handled according to national multi-dose vial policy (see Module 2, 
Section 5 for WHO policy).
Diphtheria-containing vaccines are administered as 0.5 ml doses given intramuscularly

Prevention involves immunization with pertussis vaccine, which has been given 
in combination with diphtheria and tetanus vaccines (as DTP) for many years, 
but is more recently being given in pentavalent vaccine that covers hepatitis B and 
Haemophilus influenzae type b as well as DTP. Pentavalent vaccine reduces the number 
of injections needed for infant immunization. DTP and pentavalent vaccines are 
described in the diphtheria and Haemophilus influenzae type b sections of this module. 
Sections 9.7–9.9 and Table 1.14 below describe pertussis-containing vaccines.
9.7 	 What are pertussis-containing vaccines?
Pertussis vaccine is most often given in DTP or pentavalent combination form. 
Pertussis-containing vaccines are supplied in single- and multi-dose presentations. 
Pentavalent vaccine with a freeze-dried Hib component requires reconstitution: see 
Module 5 (Managing an immunization session), Section 4.2 for details. Pertussis-
containing vaccines must be stored between +2 °C and +8 °C without being frozen. 
They are freeze-sensitive: see Module 2 (The vaccine cold chain), Section 7 for 
instructions on the Shake Test that determines whether a vial is safe to use if freezing is 
suspected. Opened multi-dose vials must be handled according to national multi-dose 
vial policy (see Module 2, Section 5 for WHO policy).
Pertussis-containing vaccines are administered as 0.5 ml doses given intramuscularly 
in the anterolateral (outer) thigh in infants and in the deltoid muscle (upper arm) of 
older children and adults.
9.8 	 How safe is pertussis vaccine and what are the potential adverse 
events following immunization?

The use of Hib vaccines should be part of a comprehensive strategy to control 
pneumonia including exclusive breastfeeding for six months, handwashing with soap, 
improved water supply and sanitation, reduction of household air pollution, and 
improved case management at community and health facility levels. Hib disease is 
included in the 2013 integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea, 
which outlines a “Prevent, Protect and Treat” framework (see Section 19 of this module).
2.8 	 What are Hib-containing vaccines?
Hib-containing vaccines prevent pneumonia, meningitis, epiglottitis, septicaemia and 
other Hib disease. They do not protect against other types of Haemophilus influenzae 
or other bacteria that cause similar diseases.
Hib-containing vaccines are available in stand-alone and combination forms. Hib 
combined with DTP and HepB vaccines, or pentavalent vaccine (DTP+HepB+Hib), 
reduces the number of injections an infant has to receive while completing the 
recommended immunization schedule.
Hib-containing vaccines are supplied in liquid or freeze-dried powder (also called 
lyophilized) formulations in single- and multi-dose presentations. Pentavalent 
vaccine is available in two- and 10-dose vials. Pentavalent vaccine with a freeze-dried 
Hib component requires reconstitution: see Module 5 (Managing an immunization

Sensitivity to heat and freezing
Figure 2.3 shows the relative heat sensitivity of vaccines. These vaccines are grouped 
into six categories. Within each of these six categories, the vaccines are arranged in 
alphabetical order, not in order of sensitivity to heat within the group. The most heat 
sensitive vaccines are in Group A and the least heat sensitive vaccines are in Group F.
Note that the heat stability information shown for freeze-dried vaccines applies only 
to unopened vials; most freeze-dried vaccines rapidly lose potency after reconstitution. 
In addition, it is important to keep opened multi-dose vaccine vials that do not 
contain preservative – whether lyophilized or liquid – cooled at temperatures between 
+2 °C and +8 °C during the immunization session, or within six hours after opening, 
whichever comes first. 
Vaccines that are sensitive to freezing and should be protected from sub-zero 
temperatures are listed in Figure 2.4.Module 2:  The vaccine cold chain

Immunization in practice
Since 2009, all WHO prequalified ice-lined, solar battery and solar direct-drive 
refrigerators have been fitted with thermostats that cannot be adjusted by the user. 
Provided power cuts are not excessive, the temperature in these refrigerators should 
always remain between +2 °C and +8 °C. If there is a recurring problem with the 
temperature control in these models, you must notify your supervisor and call the 
refrigerator technician. These newer refrigerators all carry a round red and blue sticker: 
the top red semi-circle shows the maximum allowable operating temperature and the 
bottom blue semi-circle shows the minimum operating temperature.

power supply available and the combined capacity needed for vaccine and water pack 
storage. Table 2.1 briefly describes the different refrigerator categories.
Domestic refrigerators do not have good temperature control and they cannot keep 
vaccines cool during electricity cuts of more than one or two hours. These units are not 
specifically built or designed to store vaccines. For this reason, domestic refrigerators

1.1  	Temperature requirements for vaccines 
Vaccines are sensitive biological products. Some vaccines are sensitive to freezing, some 
to heat and others to light. Vaccine potency, meaning its ability to adequately protect 
the vaccinated patient, can diminish when the vaccine is exposed to inappropriate 
temperatures. Once lost, vaccine potency cannot be regained. To maintain quality, 
vaccines must be protected from temperature extremes. Vaccine quality is maintained 
using a cold chain that meets specific temperature requirements. Figure 2.2 shows

Remember: slight heat exposure is less damaging to most liquid vaccines and diluents 
than freezing exposure. 
If the temperature is above +8 °C, which is too high, a report should be made to the 
supervisor. The corrective action includes the following procedure:
• Make sure that the refrigerator is working. If it is not working, check whether the 
power supply (electricity, gas, kerosene or solar) is adequate.
• Check whether the door of the refrigerator or the freezing compartment closes

4.3	 Maintaining the correct temperature in cold boxes 
and vaccine carriers 
To maintain the correct temperature in cold boxes and vaccine carriers, proceed as 
follows:
• Place the correct number and type of properly conditioned ice packs or cool water 
packs in the cold box or vaccine carrier. 
• If you are using conditioned ice packs you should preferably put an electronic freeze 
indicator in each cold box or vaccine carrier containing freeze-sensitive vaccines.
• Keep the cold box or vaccine carrier in the shade. 
• Keep the lid tightly closed.

1.	 Calculate the annual and monthly target population who should receive 
immunization services
Annual target population = total population × % infants in population
Aim to vaccinate every infant in the catchment area, including those who are hard 
to reach. Use existing population data for infants obtained from national statistics 
offices, ministry of health planning sections or community censuses. If data are not 
available, estimate the number of infants by multiplying the total population by 
3% (or the percentage of infants in the population suggested by national/central 
authorities, if applicable). Always use the most precise percentage available: a 
measured, specific percentage for calculating the number of infants is preferred.
Data for peripheral health facility calculations are often difficult to find and more 
accurate targets can be set by: a) immunization staff and district supervisors, who 
may need to discuss and agree on target population adjustments based on local 
knowledge and past experience; and b) drawing the past year’s results on the current 
year’s chart in order to follow progress from year to year.

Immunization in practice
The monthly target population is the annual target population number of infants 
calculated above divided by 12.
Monthly target = annual target population/12
Example calculation: If the total population is 3900, then the annual target population 
of infants is 3900 × 3/100 = 117; and the monthly target is 117/12 = 10.
2.	 Label the chart and draw the ideal monthly target line
–  	Complete the information on the top of the chart by adding the area and year.
–  	Label the left (and/or right) side of the chart with the monthly target numbers.
–  	Label the boxes at the bottom with the selected vaccine.
–  	Draw a diagonal line from zero to the top right-hand corner to show the ideal

surveillance), Section 4.1 for further discussion on calculating targets.
Divide the annual target population by 12 to get the monthly newborn/infant target:
Monthly newborn target  =  (annual target population)/12
2.  Calculate the expected number of infants per session
In order to choose the frequency of sessions, sessions, an estimate is needed of the 
expected number of infants per session for a given community. This includes the 
number of newborns presenting for first doses of vaccines and the number of infants 
returning for follow-up doses. The number of infants returning for follow-up doses 
depends on the number of contacts required by the national immunization schedule. 
For example, for a four-contact schedule, each newborn will be added to the schedule 
as a returning infant three times in later months during the year; this means that for a 
monthly session, there should be three returning infants for every newborn expected 
based on the monthly newborn target.
Table 4.14 shows the results of calculations based on the annual target population 
and the monthly newborn target to determine the expected number of newborns 
plus returning infants at individual sessions. A four-contact (minimum) schedule is 
assumed. A choice among weekly, biweekly (every two weeks), monthly and quarterly 
(every three months) is also assumed. Both the number of contacts and the choice of 
sessions may vary in different programmes.

How to complete the compilation and analysis table
1.	 List each geographic area or community served in Column a.
2.	 List the target population numbers for infants less than one year of age in 
Column b.
3.	 Enter the number of doses of each vaccine type administered to the target group 
during the preceding 12-month period in Columns c, d and e. The vaccines used 
for analysis will vary by programme.
4.	 Calculate immunization coverage as follows: Immunization coverage is the total 
number of infants who have received all required doses of a selected vaccine in the 
preceding 12 months divided by the annual target population.

6.1 	 Defaulter tracking list
An example defaulter tracking list is shown in Module 6 (Monitoring and surveillance). 
This list should be completed regularly at the end of each session or monthly, 
depending on health centre practice. A community worker or other staff should be 
assigned to find defaulters and give them appointments for the next immunization 
session. For outreach sessions, this list should be sent to the community at least a week 
in advance.
6.2 	 Other opportunities
Immunization status should be reviewed at all health care visits. Children who are 
due or overdue should be vaccinated immediately whenever possible. If vaccines are 
not immediately available for administration during the same visit, the infant should 
be referred to the earliest possible immunization session. The caregiver should be 
informed of the time, date and location of the immunization session, and the infant’s 
name should be added to the health centre defaulter tracking list to help ensure the 
follow-up visit is made.

Calculations used in determining

The following steps are needed to develop Table 4.10:
1.  Calculate the annual target population and monthly newborn target
Since infants are the target population for immunization, calculating the number of 
newborns expected in a year gives the annual target population for a programme:
Annual target population = (total population)  x  (% infants in population or 		
	
expected birth rate)
The percentage of infants in the population, or the expected birth rate, should be 
obtained from local data. If a specific local percentage is not available, the suggestion 
here is to use 3% as an estimate for session planning. See Module 6 (Monitoring and 
surveillance), Section 4.1 for further discussion on calculating targets.

Tools for monitoring
Every health facility needs a system of recording data for monitoring immunization 
services. Systematically and regularly recording the vaccinations given at each session 
ensures that services meet coverage targets (see Section 3 of this module), identifies 
defaulters and helps to actively follow up all those who need to complete their 
vaccinations.

• If there is a delay in starting the immunization schedule, give the vaccine(s) and an 
appointment for the next dose at the interval recommended in the national schedule.
3.2 	 Assess possible contraindications
For the first dose of a vaccine, assess the general status of the child to rule out signs of 
serious illness. For a subsequent dose in a vaccine series, ask the caregiver whether any 
adverse events, including anaphylaxis, occurred following the previous dose(s).
All infants should be immunized except in these situations:
• Do not give a vaccine if the infant has had anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction) 
or other severe reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or a vaccine component.
• Refer to Table 5.1 for guidance on vaccinating HIV-infected children.
• Do not give a vaccine if the caregiver objects to immunization for a sick infant after 
explanation that mild illness is not a contraindication. Ask the caregiver to come 
back when the infant is well.

Immunizing sick infants
Many health workers do not like vaccinating an infant who is ill. Infants can have 
many illnesses, but delaying immunization puts them at risk of vaccine-preventable 
diseases when they could receive the protection safely. 
• For infants with a minor illness and/or fever below 38.5 °C, vaccinate as usual. This 
includes respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea and similar mild infections without 
significant fever.
• For very ill infants who need to go to hospital, or infants who have a very high 
fever, vaccinate if possible. A senior health worker may have to decide in each case, 
but infants need protecting from diseases that could be transmissible in hospital 
(measles, for example).
• For malnourished infants, vaccinate as usual. Malnourished infants do develop 
immunity after vaccination, and when they do not receive vaccines, they are more 
likely than well-nourished children to die from vaccine-preventable diseases.
Other conditions when infants should be immunized
The following are not contraindications and infants with these conditions or 
circumstances should be immunized:
• allergies or asthma, with the exception of a known allergy to a specific component 
of the vaccine as mentioned
• ongoing treatment with antibiotics
• family history of adverse events following immunization
• prematurity or low birth weight
• history of jaundice at birth
• ongoing breastfeeding
• recent or upcoming surgery
• chronic noncommunicable diseases of the heart, lung, kidney or liver
• stable neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy or Downs syndrome
• family history of convulsions, seizures or fits.Module 5:  Managing an immunization session

caregiver. If appropriate, associate the date with a well-known occurrence, such as a 
holiday or seasonal event, that will help them remember to bring the child back.
¾
¾ Ask the caregiver to repeat the date to be sure it is understood.
¾
¾ Explain to the caregiver that if the child cannot come on the return date, they can 
obtain the next vaccination at another location or another date close to the due date.
¾
¾ Remind the caregiver to bring the immunization card when they bring the child back 
for the next vaccination.
Proceed with vaccination, including explanation of positioning, as described in 
Section 4 of this module
After vaccination
¾
¾ Remind the caregiver when to return with the infant.
¾
¾ In the event of any out-of-stocks of vaccine at the time of the session, inform the 
caregiver where and when to return for the next doses.
¾
¾ Remind the caregiver about other services given during immunization sessions, as 
per national policy; for example, vitamin A supplementation or tetanus toxoid for 
women.
¾
¾ If immunization campaigns are planned in the coming months, inform the caregiver 
about the date of the campaign, what vaccination is being given, and where the 
vaccination site will be.
¾
¾ Offer relevant print information to caregivers who are literate.
¾
¾ Ask the caregiver if they have any questions or concerns and answer them politely.Module 5:  Managing an immunization session

Immunization in practice
Assessing infants for vaccination
Before administering a vaccine to an infant, it is important to check which vaccines are due.
3.1	 Assess eligibility for immunization
Whenever an infant visits the health facility, they should be screened for immunization 
and given all the vaccines needed. If there is no immunization session that day, the 
earliest possible appointment should be made and explained to the caregiver. The steps 
below should be followed at any health care visit as well as at any immunization session.

See Module 1 (Target diseases and vaccines) for more details on vaccines and potential 
adverse events.
2.5	 Communicating other measures to help keep children safe and 
healthy
Additional specific information to convey depends on the major concerns for children 
in a community. In general, handwashing, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six 
months of life and appropriate complementary feeding after the first six months 
should be promoted. It is also important to explain to caregivers that even if their child 
receives rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines, the child may still develop diarrhoea or 
pneumonia from other causes, and they should be aware of treatment methods and 
danger signs.Module 5:  Managing an immunization session

Communication during each encounter
At the start
¾
¾ Greet the caregiver in a friendly manner. Thank them for coming for vaccination and 
for their patience if they had to wait.
¾
¾ Ask the caregiver if they have any questions or concerns and answer them politely.
During assessment (see Section 3 of this module)
¾
¾ Write the date of the vaccination(s) being given on the immunization card and explain 
the disease(s) against which the vaccination(s) protect(s) in simple terms (in the local 
language). If there is a poster or chart, use it to help your explanation.
¾
¾ Mention possible adverse events and explain how to handle them (see Section 2.4 of 
this module).
¾
¾ Explain the need for the child to return for each contact in the immunization schedule 
to be fully protected. Use the immunization card as an instructional guide, and 
congratulate the caretaker if the child has completed a series.
¾
¾ Write the date for the next vaccination on the immunization card and tell the 
caregiver. If appropriate, associate the date with a well-known occurrence, such as a 
holiday or seasonal event, that will help them remember to bring the child back.

6:  Monitoring and surveillance\nImmunization in practice\n(6)21\n2.4 \t The AEFI report form\nAEFIs need to be reported individually and tallied for the monthly summary report \n(see Section 3). The WHO definitions of AEFI and AEFI categories are given in the \nbox below. With investigation, an AEFI should fall into one of the five categories. \nInvestigation is usually carried out based on an initial health facility report of a \nsuspected AEFI (discussed further below).\nWHO definition of AEFI and AEFI categories\nAdverse event(s) following immunization (AEFI) are defined as “any untoward \nmedical occurrence that follows immunization and which does not necessarily have \na causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.” The adverse event may be any \nunfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease.\nAEFIs are grouped into five categories:\n1. Vaccine product-related reaction: An AEFI that is caused or precipitated by a \nvaccine due to one or more of the properties of the vaccine product itself.\nExample: Extensive limb swelling following DTP vaccination.\n2. Vaccine quality defect-related reaction: An AEFI that is caused or precipitated \nby a vaccine that is due to one or more quality defects of the vaccine product, \nincluding its administration device as provided by the manufacturer.\nExample: Failure by the manufacturer to completely inactivate a batch of \ninactivated polio vaccine leads to cases of paralytic polio.\n3. Immunization error-related reaction: An AEFI that is caused by inappropriate \nvaccine handling, prescribing or administration and thus by its nature is \npreventable.\nExample: Transmission of infection by contaminated multi-dose vial.\n4. Immunization anxiety-related reaction: An AEFI arising from anxiety about the \nimmunization.\nExample: Vasovagal syncope (fainting) in an adolescent during/following \nvaccination.\n5. Coincidental event: An AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine"",""metadata"":{}},{""text"":""immunization.\nExample: Vasovagal syncope (fainting) in an adolescent during/following \nvaccination.\n5. Coincidental event: An AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine \nproduct, immunization error or immunization anxiety.\nExample: A fever occurs at the time of the vaccination (temporal association) but \nis in fact caused by malaria.

2.4 	 The AEFI report form
AEFIs need to be reported individually and tallied for the monthly summary report 
(see Section 3). The WHO definitions of AEFI and AEFI categories are given in the 
box below. With investigation, an AEFI should fall into one of the five categories. 
Investigation is usually carried out based on an initial health facility report of a 
suspected AEFI (discussed further below).
WHO definition of AEFI and AEFI categories
Adverse event(s) following immunization (AEFI) are defined as “any untoward 
medical occurrence that follows immunization and which does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.” The adverse event may be any 
unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease.
AEFIs are grouped into five categories:
1. Vaccine product-related reaction: An AEFI that is caused or precipitated by a 
vaccine due to one or more of the properties of the vaccine product itself.
Example: Extensive limb swelling following DTP vaccination.
2. Vaccine quality defect-related reaction: An AEFI that is caused or precipitated 
by a vaccine that is due to one or more quality defects of the vaccine product, 
including its administration device as provided by the manufacturer.
Example: Failure by the manufacturer to completely inactivate a batch of 
inactivated polio vaccine leads to cases of paralytic polio.
3. Immunization error-related reaction: An AEFI that is caused by inappropriate 
vaccine handling, prescribing or administration and thus by its nature is 
preventable.
Example: Transmission of infection by contaminated multi-dose vial.
4. Immunization anxiety-related reaction: An AEFI arising from anxiety about the 
immunization.
Example: Vasovagal syncope (fainting) in an adolescent during/following 
vaccination.
5. Coincidental event: An AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine

immunization.
Example: Vasovagal syncope (fainting) in an adolescent during/following 
vaccination.
5. Coincidental event: An AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine 
product, immunization error or immunization anxiety.
Example: A fever occurs at the time of the vaccination (temporal association) but 
is in fact caused by malaria. Coincidental events reflect the natural occurrence 
of health problems in the community with common problems being frequently 
reported.Module 6:  Monitoring and surveillance
(6)22
Immunization in practice
National or central authorities should provide a list of suspected AEFIs that must 
be reported immediately by telephone to a manager who has the responsibility to 
investigate them. Figure 6.8 gives a guide on what to report immediately from health 
facility level. In general, any AEFI that is of concern to the parents or to the health 
worker should be reported. Note that serious AEFIs (as given in Figure 6.8) are those 
that are life threatening or result in hospitalization, disability or death.
The objective of AEFI surveillance is to detect, understand and communicate so as to 
prevent future problems. It is important to avoid blaming the vaccine first. AEFIs may 
occur in any setting, since there is no perfect vaccine and it is not possible to predict 
reactions. Health workers should not hesitate to report AEFIs for investigation.

Monthly summary reports
The immunization monitoring and vaccine-preventable disease and AEFI surveillance

reaction rates are higher than expected and, if so, are more likely to be related to the 
vaccine than to coincidence. Comparisons of reaction rates are made with published 
studies if possible. But studies are often not ideal for comparisons. Data from AEFI 
reporting are important on vaccines being used in immunization programmes. 
This is called “vaccine pharmacovigilance”. 
To help strengthen capacity to introduce vaccines in Member States, WHO 
Information Sheets on Observed Rates of Vaccine Reactions are available online. 
They provide details on selected vaccines that are relevant to the analysis of 
reported events. For further information visit the website at:

example format for a health centre stock report, giving an \nestimated monthly consumption requirement based on expected immunization service \nactivities. The consumption figures should correlate with the total number of doses \nused at sessions held during the month. This example matches the schedule given in \nTable 4.12, but each health centre should report according to national guidelines. \nStock report data may be added to the monthly summary report, as shown in \nModule 6 (Monitoring and surveillance), Section 3.Immunization in practice\n(4)23\nModule 4:  Microplanning for reaching every community\nFinding defaulters\nEvery health centre needs to plan to follow up defaulters or infants who miss scheduled \nvaccinations, who thus fall into the unimmunized or underimmunized group.

5.4 	 Health centre monthly stock report
Monthly stock reports are needed to ensure adequate supplies and avoid stock-outs. 
Table 4.13 shows an example format for a health centre stock report, giving an 
estimated monthly consumption requirement based on expected immunization service 
activities. The consumption figures should correlate with the total number of doses 
used at sessions held during the month. This example matches the schedule given in 
Table 4.12, but each health centre should report according to national guidelines. 
Stock report data may be added to the monthly summary report, as shown in 
Module 6 (Monitoring and surveillance), Section 3.Immunization in practice
(4)23
Module 4:  Microplanning for reaching every community
Finding defaulters
Every health centre needs to plan to follow up defaulters or infants who miss scheduled 
vaccinations, who thus fall into the unimmunized or underimmunized group. Refer 
to Module 6 (Monitoring and surveillance), Section 1.4 for details on defaulter 
tracking methods. This section is a brief reminder of how opportunities to complete 
vaccinations can be linked to regularly scheduled immunization services.
6.1 	 Defaulter tracking list
An example defaulter tracking list is shown in Module 6 (Monitoring and surveillance). 
This list should be completed regularly at the end of each session or monthly,

and newborn infant lists (see Module 6 (Monitoring and surveillance), Section 1).
Note that Table 4.12 is a rough estimate of needs; numbers include an average 10% 
excess and/or are rounded off to whole units. Each health centre should calculate 
its supply quantities based on the national immunization schedule and any known 
variations, such as increased numbers of infants in sessions where defaulters are 
expected to catch up even if a list of expected infants is not compiled. Health centre 
wastage rates and other similar factors should also be taken into account for both 
vaccine vial and AD syringe numbers. Quantities may be rounded off based on 
packaging and/or ease of dispensing from the pharmacy or stockroom.
Supplies for EPI Plus or other activities integrated with immunization sessions should 
be added to the table and stock lists as directed by national guidelines.
