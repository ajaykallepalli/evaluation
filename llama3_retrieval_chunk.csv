5.2 	 Analysis of vaccine-preventable disease data
Surveillance data can be used to show trends and alert to possible outbreaks, as in the 
example above. Further analysis of the trends may include a breakdown of cases by area 
or by age and sex to better identify those at high risk and to define a targeted response. 
This type of analysis is often conducted at district or more central levels, but can begin 
with individual health facility data.
High-risk or most-affected areas in the health facility catchment can be analysed 
simply by tracking cases on a map, as shown in Figure 6.16. Cases can be marked on 
the district and health centre catchment area maps prepared for microplanning, as 
described in Module 4.

Case data can be compared with immunization data to illustrate disease patterns or 
evaluate the impact of control activities. This is usually done over a longer time frame

purpose of improving service delivery, disease surveillance and AEFI data collected and 
summarized in reports are useful only if regularly analysed and interpreted to guide 
disease control activities. In fact, surveillance data may need more immediate reporting 
and analysis based on national policy, as discussed in Section 2. The initial analysis of 
surveillance data that begins at health facility level is described here.
5.1 	 Vaccine-preventable disease case number charts
The objective of surveillance is to:
• report vaccine-preventable diseases according to national protocol; reports may be 
required monthly, weekly or as needed for outbreak response
• understand the data collected as a guide for response. 
In addition to predicting or detecting outbreaks, identifying high-risk populations 
or areas and monitoring the impact of immunization services, surveillance data can 
highlight system weaknesses, determine disease burden in a community and document 
circulating strains of pathogens.
Case numbers can be presented in graphs for display in the health facility. Trends in 
disease occurrence (usually incidence) are easy to visualize and compare to immunization 
data in this format. Graphs of trends that become outbreaks are also called “epidemic 
curves”. Keeping updated graphs will allow comparisons between seasons and years and 
alert to any increases in the number of cases or other relevant trends.

Tools for surveillance
Just as every health facility needs a system of recording immunization data for 
monitoring, it also needs a system of recording surveillance data on vaccine-
preventable diseases and adverse events following immunization (AEFIs).
National- or central-level authorities should provide a list of diseases, the forms to be 
completed and a protocol describing how cases should be reported.
AEFI reporting is included routinely in summary reports, but may also require 
immediate notification by phone to relevant managers and authorities as directed by 
national or central-level guidelines (see Section 2.3).
The main tools used for surveillance in health facilities are:
• the vaccine-preventable diseases or integrated communicable diseases tally sheet
• the disease-specific case investigation report form
• the line list
• the AEFI report form.
2.1 	 The vaccine-preventable disease tally sheet
Vaccine-preventable disease cases should be tallied when they are seen at a health 
facility or outreach site. The total number for each type of disease should be added 
for reporting to central levels. This is often done monthly in a summary form. An 
example monthly summary form is shown in Figure 6.10 and discussed in Section 3",3.906,"{""id"":""chatcmpl-8dec5534029043ae926b2f7a6ccfd122"",""choices"":[{""finish_reason"":""stop"",""index"":0,""logprobs"":null,""message"":{""content"":""The search results do not provide information on how to test if a vaccine has been damaged due to exposure to temperatures below zero.

6.10	When are measles-containing vaccines administered?
All children should receive two doses of MCV. Very high (90–95%) coverage with 
both doses is required to prevent measles outbreaks. The first dose (MCV1) should be 
given at nine or 12 months of age. Because many cases of measles occur in children 
over 12 months of age who have not been vaccinated, routine delivery of MCV1 
should not be limited to infants ages nine to 12 months. All unvaccinated children 
over 12 months should be offered MCV1 using every opportunity when the child 
comes in contact with health services.
MCV2 should be given between 15–18 months of age. Vaccinating in the second year 
of life reduces the number of unprotected children. This may be linked to the timing 
of other routine immunizations (for example, a DTP booster). Screening for measles 
vaccination at school entry helps to ensure that all children receive both doses.

Key points about mumps
¾
¾ Mumps is transmitted in airborne droplets emitted by infected individuals when 
they cough or sneeze.
¾
¾ About one-third of individuals infected with mumps have no symptoms.
¾
¾ The most prominent sign is swelling in the salivary glands.
¾
¾ Complications from mumps are rare but can be serious.
¾
¾ Mumps vaccine should be given in combination with measles and rubella vaccines 
(MMR) in high-performing immunization programmes with coverage over 80%.

cause of the problem.
Protecting the vaccines 
Move the vaccines to other cold chain equipment until the refrigerator is repaired. 
For a problem that can be solved quickly, a cold box or vaccine carrier lined with

2.3 	 Vaccine carriers 
Vaccine carriers are smaller than cold boxes and easier to carry (see Figure 2.7). 
Current prequalified vaccine carriers have a cold life with frozen ice packs of between 
18 and 50 hours at +43 °C and a cool life with cool water packs of between three and 
18 hours. 
Vaccine carriers are generally used for the following purposes:
• To transport vaccines and diluents to 
outreach sites and store them during 
health facility immunization sessions.
• To store vaccines temporarily when the 
health facility refrigerator is out of order 
or is being defrosted.
• To transport monthly vaccine supplies 
from the district store to small health 
facilities. 
Vaccine carriers used at the health facility 
should be chosen based on the following 
factors:
• The type and quantity of vaccines and 
diluents to be transported. 
• The cold or cool life needed for the 
longest planned journeys.
• The transport method used (for example, 
the requirements for a vaccine carrier that 
will be carried for short distances on foot 
are not the same as those for one that will 
be transported for long distances on the 
back of a motorcycle).

2.2 	 Cold boxes 
A cold box is an insulated container that can be lined with water packs to keep 
vaccines and diluents in the required temperature range during transport or short-term 
storage – see Figure 2.6. Depending on the model, cold boxes can be used to store 
vaccines for periods of up to two days or more when there is no electricity available, 
when the health facility refrigerator is out of order, or when a passive container is 
needed while the refrigerator is being defrosted. Once packed, cold boxes should not 
be opened until the vaccine is needed.
The “cold life” of a cold box is the maximum 
length of time that a closed cold box can maintain 
temperatures below +10 °C when it is lined with 
frozen ice packs. Current prequalified cold box 
models have a maximum cold life of two to seven 
days when tested at a constant +43 °C. 
The “cool life” of a cold box is the maximum 
length of time the closed cold box can maintain 
temperatures below +20 °C if lined with cool 
water packs that have been stored in a refrigerator. 
Current prequalified cold box models have a 
maximum cool life of 12 hours to two days when 
tested at a constant +43 °C. 
A cold box to be used at health facility level should 
be chosen based on the following factors:

vaccine carriers exactly as shown on the manufacturer’s instructions on the inside 
of the lid. 
2.	 Put the vaccines and diluents in a plastic bag in the middle of the cold box or 
carrier to protect them from damage due to condensation. 
3.	 If conditioned ice packs are used, put an electronic freeze indicator with the 
vaccines.
4.	 For vaccine carriers, place the foam pad in the top of the container. 
5.	 Close the cold box or vaccine carrier lid tightly.
Figure 2.24 illustrates the procedures for arranging cold boxes and vaccine carriers.
Note: If a cool water pack strategy has been adopted for outreach operations, one 
or more frozen ice packs must be brought to the session to ensure that opened 
multi-dose vaccine vials are kept at recommended temperatures. It is particularly 
important that vaccines that do not contain preservative – whether lyophilized or 
liquid – are kept at temperatures between +2 °C and +8 °C during the session.Module 2:  The vaccine cold chain

Immunization in practice
Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions and never overload the freezing 
compartment. Put packs in the freezer, arranged upright or on their sides so that the 
surface is touching the evaporator plate. If there is a door or lid to the compartment, 
make sure it is properly closed. 
The more packs placed in the freezing compartment, the longer they will take to freeze. 
If too may water packs are placed in the unit, they may not freeze at all. Keep extra,

vaccine out of the traditional +2 °C to +8 °C cold chain for a limited period of time, at 
temperatures of up to 40 °C, just before administration. Vaccines licensed accordingly 
can be used in a CTC. The CTC approach can be adopted by countries for carefully 
chosen circumstances, such as for special strategies or mass vaccination campaigns.
1.2	 The cold chain at health centre or peripheral health facility level
At the health facility level (usually health centres and health posts), health workers can 
adequately protect vaccines by doing the following:
• Keep vaccines in appropriate vaccine refrigeration equipment.
• Use a temperature monitoring device to ensure temperatures remain between +2 °C 
and +8 °C.
• Transport vaccines to immunization sessions in a vaccine carrier, correctly packed, 
using coolant packs that have been properly prepared, as described in Section 2.4 
of this module.
• During immunization sessions, fit a foam pad (if available) at the top of the vaccine 
carrier, as described in Section 2.5 of this module. 
At the health facility, one person must have overall responsibility for managing the 
vaccine cold chain. A second person can fill in when the primary person is absent. 
Their responsibilities should include:
• checking and recording vaccine temperatures twice daily; typically in the morning 
and at the end of the session or day
• properly storing vaccines, diluents and water packs
• handling preventative maintenance of the cold chain equipment.",2.944,"{""id"":""chatcmpl-c2c06262539844deb81d53aac8228adb"",""choices"":[{""finish_reason"":""stop"",""index"":0,""logprobs"":null,""message"":{""content"":""The search results provided do not contain information about the Japanese encephalitis vaccine or its administration to patients with epilepsy.

Seasonal influenza
14.1	What is seasonal influenza?
Seasonal influenza is a respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses A and B. In 
temperate climates, it can occur primarily in winter epidemics. In tropical climates, 
it can occur year-round with high attack rates and deaths. Globally, seasonal influenza 
can affect 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children each year. Children under five 
years of age, pregnant women, the elderly (over 65 years of age) and people with 
HIV/AIDS, asthma, and other chronic heart or lung conditions are at greater risk.
14.2	How is seasonal influenza spread?
Influenza A and B viruses are spread mainly in droplets and aerosols released when an 
infected person coughs or sneezes.
14.3	What are the symptoms and signs of seasonal influenza?
Symptoms of influenza usually occur after a one- to four-day incubation period and 
include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache and muscle and joint aches. 
Signs of severe disease in children include difficulty breathing, increased respiratory 
rate, poor feeding, irritability, dehydration and decreased alertness.
14.4	What are the complications of seasonal influenza?

• Acute diseases, severe chronic diseases, and chronic diseases with acute symptoms and/or fever
• Encephalopathy (brain disease), uncontrolled epilepsy (seizures) or other diseases of the nervous 
system
Adverse events
High fever (5–7% of those vaccinated); injection site reactions (redness, swelling: in less than 1% with 
some types of vaccine); low-grade fever, irritability, nausea and dizziness (rare) 
Special precautions
• Review medical history – caution needed for family or individual history of seizures or other chronic 
diseases, allergies and for women who are lactating
• Postpone vaccination for at least 3 months if the person has been given immunoglobulin
• There should be at least a 1 month interval (either before or after) between JE and other live vaccines 
• Women of childbearing age should avoid pregnancy for at least 3 months after immunization 
• Live attenuated JE vaccine is not meant to be given during JE epidemic seasons

	* A designated area for observation after vaccination.
5. **Manage crowd control**: To avoid overcrowding and long wait times, consider implementing a ticketing system, numbered queues, or scheduled appointment times.
6. **Seek support from local authorities**: Inform local health authorities, community leaders, or other stakeholders about the vaccination effort. They may be able to provide additional resources, personnel, or logistical support.
7. **Plan for vaccine storage and handling**: Ensure that vaccines are stored and handled properly to maintain their potency and safety.
8. **Prepare for emergencies**: Have a plan in place for managing any adverse reactions or emergencies that may arise during the vaccination session.
9. **Communicate effectively**: Clearly communicate the vaccination schedule, process, and any important information to the community through various channels (e.g., social media, local newspapers, community meetings).
10. **Review and adjust**: After each vaccination session, review the process and make adjustments as needed to improve efficiency, safety, and community satisfaction.

Remember, managing a large-scale vaccination effort can be challenging. Be flexible, and don't hesitate to seek help or guidance from local health authorities or experienced vaccinators if needed.",18.678,Section 4.5 Making a session plan p.(4)18 How to choose session frequency

2.10	When is Hib-containing vaccine administered?
Since serious Hib disease occurs mainly before 24 months of age, and infants are 
most at risk at between four and 18 months of age, Hib-containing vaccines should 
be included in all infant immunization schedules. Any of three schedules may be 
followed: three primary doses without a booster (3p+0), two primary doses plus a 
booster (2p+1), and three primary doses with a booster (3p+1). The series should start 
from six weeks of age, or as early as possible thereafter. The interval between doses 
should be at least four weeks if three primary doses are given, and at least eight weeks 
if two primary doses are given. When given, the booster dose should be given at least 
six months after completion of the primary series. Children who start vaccination late, 
but are aged less than 12 months, should complete the schedule. When a first dose is 
given to a child over 12 months of age, only one dose is recommended. Hib vaccine is 
not required for healthy children after five years of age. 
Key points about Hib disease
¾
¾ Hib disease primarily affects children under two years of age in developing 
countries.
¾
¾ Healthy carriers as well as sick patients can spread Hib.
¾

apart followed by a third dose after six to 12 months is recommended.
When combined with tetanus vaccine, a total childhood schedule of five doses is 
required: three in infancy, another (DT) in early childhood (1–6 years) and another 
(dT) during adolescence (12–15 years). A further dose in adulthood is likely to provide 
lifelong protection.
Key points about diphtheria
¾
¾ Diphtheria is spread from person to person in airborne droplets.
¾
¾ Symptoms of the disease include sore throat, loss of appetite and mild fever.
¾
¾ Patients with the disease can experience complications, such as abnormal 
heartbeat and inflammation of the heart muscle and valves, and this can lead to 
heart failure.
¾
¾ Children with diphtheria should be treated with diphtheria antitoxin and 
antibiotics.
¾
¾ The most effective way to prevent the disease is to maintain a high level of 
immunization within a community.Module 1:  Target diseases and vaccines

Immunization in practice
2.5 	 What is the treatment for Hib disease?
Hib disease can be treated with antibiotics, such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, 
cephalosporins and chloramphenicol. Hib that is resistant to some of the commonly 
used antibiotics is now being seen in many parts of the world.
2.6 	 How is Hib disease prevented?
Hib disease is best prevented by Hib-containing vaccine given in infancy or before 
24 months of age. Vaccination is becoming increasingly important as Hib antibiotic

in countries with high mortality in children under five years of age (more than 
50/1000 live births). Three doses are required and can be given as a three-primary 
(3p+0) or, as an alternative, two-primary-plus-one booster (2p+1) schedule. The 3p+0 
schedule can be started as early as six weeks of age, with a minimum interval of four 
weeks between doses. The 2p+1 schedule is shown in Table 1.16 below. In choosing 
between schedules factors such as the epidemiology of the disease, likely coverage, and 
the timeliness of vaccination should be considered.
Once a series has been started, the same product should ideally be used for all three 
doses; for example, if PCV10 is used for the first dose, it should be used for the second 
and third doses also. If this is not possible, the schedule may be completed with the 
available PCV.
Previously unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children, including those who 
recover from pneumococcal disease, should be vaccinated according to their age. 
Children 12–24 months require only two doses, with an interval of at least eight 
weeks.
Key points about pneumococcal disease
¾
¾ Pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of death in children under five years of 
age, especially in developing countries.
¾
¾ The pneumococcus can cause infections in different parts of the body; the most 
common severe diseases are pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia.
¾
¾ Healthy carriers as well as patients can spread pneumococcus.
¾

24 months of age. Vaccination is becoming increasingly important as Hib antibiotic 
resistance grows. Sections 2.8–2.10 and Table 1.2 below describe Hib-containing 
vaccines, including pentavalent vaccine. 
2.7 	 What is needed for global Hib disease control?
The use of Hib vaccines should be part of a comprehensive strategy to control 
pneumonia including exclusive breastfeeding for six months, handwashing with soap, 
improved water supply and sanitation, reduction of household air pollution, and 
improved case management at community and health facility levels. Hib disease is 
included in the 2013 integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea, 
which outlines a “Prevent, Protect and Treat” framework (see Section 19 of this module).
2.8 	 What are Hib-containing vaccines?
Hib-containing vaccines prevent pneumonia, meningitis, epiglottitis, septicaemia and 
other Hib disease. They do not protect against other types of Haemophilus influenzae 
or other bacteria that cause similar diseases.
Hib-containing vaccines are available in stand-alone and combination forms. Hib 
combined with DTP and HepB vaccines, or pentavalent vaccine (DTP+HepB+Hib), 
reduces the number of injections an infant has to receive while completing the 
recommended immunization schedule.

example monthly summary form is shown in Figure 6.10 and discussed in Section 3 
of this module. Copies of the second page of the form in Figure 6.10 may be made for 
daily or weekly tallies at health centre and outreach sites and then be compiled for the 
monthly report.
What information is commonly included in a vaccine-preventable disease 
tally sheet?
The vaccine-preventable diseases included in the tally should match the list of diseases 
that must be reported to national or central authorities. A case definition for each 
disease on the list should be obtained from national or central level to help make the 
reporting more accurate. Age, sex and vaccination status of the patient are usually 
required. Health centre consultation registers should be adapted as needed to allow 
space for this and/or other information required by national authorities.

How to use a vaccine-preventable disease tally sheet
If cases of vaccine-preventable diseases are tracked in curative service tally sheets daily 
or weekly, take the numbers from the matching lines on these sheets to calculate 
the monthly tally, which is then used in the monthly summary report. If curative 
service visits are entered in a register without being added to tally sheets, review 
the consultation register for the total number of cases of each vaccine-preventable",3.940,"{""id"":""chatcmpl-7a753e248ae6454b8c1824077a58aee9"",""choices"":[{""finish_reason"":""stop"",""index"":0,""logprobs"":null,""message"":{""content"":""The search results do not provide information on how to verify the validity of a batch of vials with complete labeling, excluding expiration dates.

About this module…
This module describes the tasks a health worker needs to perform to ensure the quality of 
an immunization session. It starts with the preparation required at the health centre and the 
immunization site before the infants arrive. It next discusses the communication needed 
throughout each encounter with caregivers during the session. It then proceeds with assessment 
of infants before vaccination, the correct technique for giving vaccines, and instructions for

1.  Calculate the annual target population and monthly newborn target
Since infants are the target population for immunization, calculating the number of 
newborns expected in a year gives the annual target population for a programme:
Annual target population = (total population)  x  (% infants in population or 		
	
expected birth rate)
The percentage of infants in the population, or the expected birth rate, should be 
obtained from local data. If a specific local percentage is not available, the suggestion 
here is to use 3% as an estimate for session planning. See Module 6 (Monitoring and 
surveillance), Section 4.1 for further discussion on calculating targets.
Divide the annual target population by 12 to get the monthly newborn/infant target:
Monthly newborn target  =  (annual target population)/12
2.  Calculate the expected number of infants per session
In order to choose the frequency of sessions, sessions, an estimate is needed of the 
expected number of infants per session for a given community. This includes the 
number of newborns presenting for first doses of vaccines and the number of infants 
returning for follow-up doses. The number of infants returning for follow-up doses 
depends on the number of contacts required by the national immunization schedule. 
For example, for a four-contact schedule, each newborn will be added to the schedule 
as a returning infant three times in later months during the year; this means that for a

population and estimated proportions of infants in the total population (see Annex 4.1 
for calculation details).

How to choose session frequency
Table 4.10 estimates the best use of staff time based on the number of vaccinators 
expected to be available for each session in a range of population sizes. Find the total 
population of the community to be served and choose the session frequency based 
on the number of vaccinators available for the immunization team. The following are 
some examples:
• for a community with a total population of 6000 and an immunization team with 
two vaccinators per session, session frequency should be every two weeks
• for a community with a total population of 3000 and an immunization team with 
one vaccinator per session, session frequency should be monthly
• for a community with a total population of 500 and an immunization team with 
one vaccinator per session, session frequency should be quarterly.",2.235,"{""id"":""chatcmpl-db196048c21b42b4a0475a5da6da05f0"",""choices"":[{""finish_reason"":""stop"",""index"":0,""logprobs"":null,""message"":{""content"":""The search results do not provide information on whether a child infected with HIV can receive the Yellow fever vaccine.

Defaulters can be listed by reviewing different immunization records. Two suggested 
methods are:
Listing defaulters using the immunization register
At the end of each month, review the immunization register to identify infants who 
may have failed to receive vaccinations when due. For example, in March check 
to see that any infant who received a pentavalent1 dose in February returned for 
pentavalent2 (in March) when it was due. Add the names of any infants who missed 
vaccinations to the defaulter tracking list. Names should be listed for tracking and 
follow-up as soon as possible after a missed appointment.
Figure 6.4 shows a completed example of the register shown in Figure 6.1 (A). Note 
that looking at each line helps visualize which infants have missed vaccinations and so 
should be added to the defaulter tracking list.Module 6:  Monitoring and surveillance

new page (not shown).
Listing defaulters using reminder cards
Reminder cards are copies of infants’ immunization cards that can be filed in a 
box by the month when the next vaccination is due (see Figure 6.5). For example, 
when an infant receives pentavalent1 in January, mark it on the reminder card and 
place the card behind the February divider, since this is when pentavalent2 is due. 
In February, if the infant receives pentavalent2, update the reminder card and place 
it in the March section when pentavalent3 is due. If the infant does not come for 
pentavalent2 in February, or does come but does not get vaccinated (due to stock-outs 
or other reasons), the card will remain in February. At the end of each month, review 
all the reminder cards remaining and add the names of the infants who have missed 
vaccinations to the defaulter tracking list.Module 6:  Monitoring and surveillance

How to use the defaulter tracking list
The defaulter tracking list will be effective only if every infant receives vaccinations 
that are overdue. Listing defaulters regularly every month makes it easier to find them 
and follow them up. To follow up defaulters, caregivers may be contacted directly 
(for example by phone or text messaging) or with the help of other community 
members. Module 7 (Partnering with communities) gives more detail on working with 
communities.

Note that:
• This example is typed for clarity. A handwritten register may be used.
• This is a register for a single village. Addresses may need to be written in more detail 
if more than one village is included in the same register.
• It shows the first page for a specific month: January 2013. The identification 
numbers are continued from the previous year and this is why the ID No column 
starts with the number 511.
• ID No 511 was born on 1/1/13 but added to the register on 3/1.
• ID No 512 did not return after receiving his second doses. He was added to the 
defaulter tracking list and found to have moved out of the catchment area.
• ID No 515 has not received a dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) and is still 
under defaulter tracking.
• ID No 516 was born at home and registered after the health worker was notified by 
a community volunteer. Defaulter tracking found that the family subsequently left 
the catchment area.
• ID No 517 received birth doses in the hospital on 5/11/12 but then presented at 
irregular intervals for follow-up. She is now up-to-date.
• ID No 513, 514 and 518 are up to date according to the example immunization 
schedule used in this module.
• ID No 519 did not return after his first doses. Defaulter tracking found that the 
family declined any further immunizations.
• The last line is blank since the next infant was added in February, which starts on a 
new page (not shown).

any vaccinations. This will help to follow up new infants along with older ones on the 
defaulter tracking list.
Two different infant immunization register examples are shown in Figure 6.1.
• With both examples, a new month can be started at the top of the next page even if 
there are some lines left on the current page. For example, on 31 January there may 
be five lines blank on the current page but on 1 February registration of new infants 
should start at the top of the next page. This will make it easier to find infants 
returning without their immunization cards and to compile defaulter tracking lists 
(see Section 1.4 of this module).
• The first example (A) is organized by vaccine and the doses required for the series. 
With this format, it is easy to see whether an infant is fully immunized with each 
antigen.
• The second example (B) is organized by vaccines that are usually given in the same 
visit when following the example immunization schedule. With this format, it is 
easy to see which doses are needed each time an infant comes to a session. It is also 
easy to see which infants have missed vaccinations and need to be included in the 
defaulter tracking list (see Section 1.4 of this module).
These are suggestions. Any format used should match national guidelines and be 
coordinated with the method used to track defaulters, as described in Section 1.4 of 
this module.Module 6:  Monitoring and surveillance

4.3 	 Making vaccination easier and more comfortable
The way a health worker interacts with children and their caregivers has a huge impact 
and they will respond positively to a friendly, welcoming attitude.
Recent recommendations for new vaccines and catch-up dose schedules often mean 
giving two (or more) injections to an infant during the same session. Giving multiple 
injections at the same time is, of course, more difficult, but it is a skill that must be 
learnt. With practice, giving injections quickly and safely with little distress to the 
infant and caregiver will become routine. Even the most experienced vaccinator should 
take time to review their injection technique and seek out refresher materials that 
might improve their skills. Vaccinators should also share their knowledge and learn 
from each other.
4.4 	 Good general techniques

syringes in advance.
• Never leave the needle in the top of the vaccine vial.
• Follow product-specific recommendations for storage, handling and use of vaccines.
–– Follow safe procedures to reconstitute vaccines. The correct diluent must be used 
for reconstituting freeze-dried vaccines.
–– Use only the diluent supplied by the manufacturer for each vaccine – check the 
labels.
–– Diluents must be cooled before reconstitution.
• Dispose of used AD and RUP needles and syringes in a safety box.
• Follow national multi-dose vial policy for opened vials.
• Use a new AD needle and syringe for every child:
–– Inspect the packaging very carefully.
–– Discard the needle and syringe if the package has been punctured, torn or 
damaged in any way.
–– Do not touch any part of the needle.
• Discard a needle that has touched any non-sterile surface.
• Position the child carefully to minimize risk of movement and injury.

Preventing needle-stick injuries
Needles can be dangerous. They can injure health workers and, if contaminated with 
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV or other infections, they can transmit diseases.
Needle-stick injuries can happen at any time, particularly during and immediately 
after an injection. This risk is increased when: 
• health workers recap needles or walk around carrying used needles

children, and the safe disposal of materials.
4.1 	 Preparing to vaccinate
Injectable vaccines can be ready to use or can require reconstitution (mixing) 
with diluent. Oral vaccines may require manipulation of the packaging to enable 
administration. With the increasing range of products and presentations available, the 
aim of this section is to cover general principles that can be adapted to specific vaccines 
in each programme.
Firstly, use aseptic technique to prepare vaccines:
• start with handwashing – use soap and water and dry your hands thoroughly
• work on a clean table
• prepare vaccines individually for each child; do not prefill syringes.
Whenever possible, prepare the vaccine away from the child and caregiver; be aware 
that injection materials may cause anxiety. If this is not possible, turn away slightly 
to shield the preparation. Try to talk to the caregiver while preparing injections as 
showing interest in the caregiver is reassuring.
4.2 	 Reconstituting vaccines
Common vaccines that need to be mixed with diluent before use include BCG, yellow 
fever, measles, MR and MMR. The correct diluent must be used (see box).

Immunization in practice
Steps for reconstitution
1.	 	For vials with VVMs, double check that the vaccine can be used.
2.	 	Double check each vial/ampoule to make sure it is not past its expiry date, and read 
the label carefully.

Take one AD syringe for each dose of injectable vaccine and add 10% buffer stock. 
Note that separate calculations for two types of syringes, AD and BCG AD, are needed 
in most programmes. Take one reconstitution syringe and needle for each vial of 
vaccine to be used. Take one safety box for every 100 AD syringes. 
Ensure correct use of coolant packs and vaccine carriers
Do not use ice packs for vials that will be out of the cold chain for a limited time at 
fixed or outreach immunization sessions as the risk of freezing is greater than the risk 
of damage from heat for vials kept in a vaccine carrier for less than a day. Conditioned 
ice packs are recommended to avoid freezing vaccines. 
Keep open vials inserted in the foam pad of the vaccine carrier during immunization 
sessions. Do not keep opened vials on ice.Module 5:  Managing an immunization session

Communicating with caregivers
Communication involves giving information verbally (including the tone of voice) and 
non-verbally (body language). It is an essential part of vaccinator technique needed 
from start to finish of the interaction with each child and caregiver. Communication 
during the immunization encounter is also important for giving health education;
